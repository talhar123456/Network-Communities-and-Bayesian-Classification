# Network-Communities-and-Bayesian-Classification
This repository focuses on the implementation of network community detection using the Radicchi et al. algorithm and a Naive Bayes classifier for predictive modeling. These tools provide a hands-on approach to understanding complex network structures and applying machine learning techniques to classification problems.
